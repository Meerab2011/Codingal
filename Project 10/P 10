        <h3>Animals</h3>
        <h5>A characteristic of members of the animal kingdom is the presence of muscles and the mobility they afford. Mobility is
        an important influence on how an organism obtains nutrients for growth and reproduction. Animals typically move, in one
        way or another, to feed on other living organisms, but some consume dead organic matter or even photosynthesize by
        housing symbiotic algae. The type of nutrition is not as decisive as the type of mobility in distinguishing animals from
        the other two multicellular kingdoms. Some plants and fungi prey on animals by using movements based on changing turgor
        pressure in key cells, as compared with the myofilament-based mobility seen in animals. Mobility requires the
        development of vastly more elaborate senses and internal communication than are found in plants or fungi. It also
        requires a different mode of growth: animals increase in size mostly by expanding all parts of the body, whereas plants
        and fungi mostly extend their terminal edges.</h5>

        <h3>Fruit</h3>
        <h5>Fruits are important sources of dietary fibre, vitamins (especially vitamin C), and antioxidants. Although fresh fruits
        are subject to spoilage, their shelf life can be extended by refrigeration or by the removal of oxygen from their
        storage or packaging containers. Fruits can be processed into juices, jams, and jellies and preserved by dehydration,
        canning, fermentation, and pickling. Waxes, such as those from bayberries (wax myrtles), and vegetable ivory from the
        hard fruits of a South American palm species (Phytelephas macrocarpa) are important fruit-derived products. Various
        drugs come from fruits, such as morphine from the fruit of the opium poppy.</h5>
